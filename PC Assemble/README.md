# Reflection 
## Summarize on what I have gained :
Now I have gained a firm grasp of how hardware and software components interact to produce a completely functional computer system thanks to my experience constructing PCs. In addition, I've developed useful troubleshooting and problem-solving abilities that have aided me in resolving technical problems that can come up during assembly. My teammates and I cooperate together until the PC is working again. In addition, while building a PC from the ground up, I've gained expertise and knowledge that will be useful for next technical developments. I came to see how invaluable the practical experience this course offered was. Along with gaining useful technical skills, I also solidified my knowledge and comprehension base. I will always remember my wonderful experience in this training. 

## Suggestion on improvement :
Smaller functions and quicker assembly times will improve the PC Assemble Lab session and make the assembly process more effective and interesting for the students. Additionally, in order to provide students with a range of difficulties and learning opportunities, we should include several computer setups with varying assembly limits, levels of complexity, and unique features.

## Others
We might attempt adding a new challenge where teams who finish early get assigned an additional assignment to do in an effort to make this experience more engaging. To examine the differences between old and new PCs, they could, for instance, disassemble a recent batch of computers. This method not only raises the difficulty level but also stimulates interest in the subject.

# Reflection 
## Summarize on what I have gained :
I gained about I-FARM, a vertical hydroponic farming project designed to supply nearby communities with fresh veggies. The technology optimizes growing conditions through machine learning algorithms, allowing residents to order and harvest locally farmed vegetables. I-FARM works with local farmers to expand in Malaysia while addressing problems with the food supply chain that have been made worse by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company optimizes vegetable development but is considering diversifying into other crops as well. It does this by taking use of its climate-controlled, enclosed space, which guarantees reliable yields regardless of weather. Consumer desire in locally farmed organic produce is indicated by market research, and I-FARM's innovation makes fresh vegetables accessible to everyone—even housewives—during pandemics.

## Suggestion on improvement :
I think to make I-FARM have a new improvement, they could think about expanding the variety of crops you choose to appeal to a wider range of customers and boost market share. You should also keep up with market research to stay abreast of changing consumer tastes. Examine previous expansion prospects, including those in Singapore, to see whether expanding outside of Malaysia is feasible while keeping an eye on regional collaborations and community involvement. To improve hydroponic farming's sustainability and efficiency, deepen technological integration by introducing new machine learning algorithms. Encourage more community involvement by putting an emphasis on sustainability projects like water conservation and the integration of renewable energy sources, encouraging openness in business practices, and running educational programs. Improve the supply chain to reduce food waste and provide a steady supply of fresh product, possibly by forming alliances with nearby merchants or delivery services.

## Others
In my opinion, I-Farm really did a great job on producing fresh vegetables based on the market demand which is good alternative to reduce food wastages. With a thorough awareness of customer tastes and market dynamics, strategic decision-making is guided by focused expansion efforts, supported by market research and an emphasis on locally sourced organic produce. The agriculture business is dynamic, and this is acknowledged by the culture of constant development and learning, which motivates attempts to optimize supply chains, improve customer involvement, and investigate technological integration and sustainability. 
All things considered, I-FARM's efforts have a beneficial effect on community well-being, sustainability, and food security. They also serve as an excellent illustration of how creative agricultural techniques can help create more resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems in the future.
